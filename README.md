This is my first project to fullfill Revou fullstack Engineer program 

## Milestone 1
my task is to make responsive web using HTML and CSS. i Give my website's name , Travelook. Travelook should be a web that can support local or international tourist to find interest place in Bali

### Project
in index.html, i use standard doctype and meta name to enhance responsiveness.
to easily memorise the part of my website, i make this " <!---custom css link--> ". so i can work neater and it helps me to memorise what part of my website when i style my website with CSS.

i use boxicon to enhance that people can connect Travelook through social media like Twitter, Instagram and WHatsapp

i use google font poppin to make my website have some strong letter. initially i want to use Helvetica font, but apparently Helvetica already deleted in google font due to copyright.

I make navbar with combination of Java script . in the end i can't make navbar using HTML and CSS because its too long and difficult, with Java Script is more easily


#### How to deploy my website
I use Niagara Hoster to hosting my website !
first, you need to sign up to niagara hoster with your email account. 
after that you need to buy domain. for my case, i buy travelook.shop because its cheap and i think its good for my practice.

secondly, you need to open your github and fork your repository

after that, you must setting your Vercel account and connect to your github account and Niaga Hoster. 

##### Another explanation, soon will updated by me!

Then you must set your account at Niaga hoster
